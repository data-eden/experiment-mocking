# GraphQL Faker

## Setup

To initialize `graphql-faker` with the fake/test schema in this repository, run the following `yarn graphql-faker ./schemas/graphql-faker.graphql`.

Once doing so, you should be able to get fake data in a few ways:

1. Visit [http://localhost:9002/editor](http://localhost:9002/editor) to view an interactive editor

1. Hit the fake GraphQL API directly (e.g., using Postman) at the following endpoint: [http://localhost:9002/graphql](http://localhost:9002/graphql)
